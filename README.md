# This is a tryout repository to learn how to work with git

Two files that are here are to process the spectrograms (frogograms) from from meaasurement and visualise/plot them with scales, when together loading the time and spectral files. This works with commercial frog that Fengling uses

# I introduce a change here to try out git status 

# I introduce more change after creating a new branch called "try-out"

# Added an emergency branch
