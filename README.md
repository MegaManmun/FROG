# FROG files used in HHG setup at Stefan Witte lab, where they have a commercial FROG

Two files that are here are to process the spectrograms (frogograms) from from measurement and visualise/plot them with scales, when together loading the time and spectral files. This works with commercial frog that Fengling uses.
